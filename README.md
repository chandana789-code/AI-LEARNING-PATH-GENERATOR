# AI-Powered Personalized Learning Path Generator
## Problem Statement
 
**Title:** AI-Based Personalized Learning Path Generation System

Traditional education systems often follow a uniform teaching approach, which does not address individual learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses. As a result, many students face learning gaps and reduced engagement. Personalized learning paths can significantly improve understanding, motivation, and academic performance by adapting content to each learner’s needs.

The challenge is to design an AI-based system that analyzes student performance and learning preferences to generate customized learning paths. Such a system can support both students and educators by providing data-driven insights and adaptive learning recommendations.
## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered personalized learning platform that analyzes student data to generate customized learning paths. Using machine learning techniques, the system recommends suitable learning resources and adaptive quizzes, helping students learn efficiently at their own pace while enabling educators to track progress and improve learning outcomes.
## Dataset

The dataset consists of student-related information such as performance scores, learning preferences, and progress details.
You can find the dataset in the sample_data.csv file.
## Tools & Technologies

Pandas: For student data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Scikit-Learn: For machine learning model development.
